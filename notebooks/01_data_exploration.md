# 01 – Data Exploration

Purpose:
- Inspect class balance, image resolutions, and quality of the raw coral bleaching dataset.
- Prototype preprocessing and augmentation strategies prior to formalizing pipelines in `utils/preprocessing.py`.
- Capture exploratory plots (histograms, sample grids) that motivate downstream modeling choices.

Checklist:
- [ ] Load metadata from `data/raw/`.
- [ ] Visualize sample images per class.
- [ ] Record observations and open questions for preprocessing.
